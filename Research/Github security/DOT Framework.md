<strong>Field research is done to explore the application context. You apply a field strategy to get to know your end users, their needs, desires and limitations as organizational and physical contexts in which they will use your product.</strong>

### Lab

<strong>Showroom research is done to test your ideas in relation to existing work. Showing your prototype to experts can be a form of showroom research or spelling out how your product is different from the competition. Also testing your product to general guidelines is a form of showroom research.</strong>

### Workshop
