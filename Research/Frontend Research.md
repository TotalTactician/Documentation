# Research Front-end framework

### VUE

The difference between Svelte and Vue lies also in versatility. Vue is pretty much a universal framework that can be used for any project of yours.
The most suitable apps developed in this framework are single-page apps, MVPs, progressive web apps, and dynamic landing pages. In React, Svelte, and Vue comparison only Svelte is somewhat specific in its functionality, React and Vue can do pretty much everything.

### Svelte JS

Rich Harris, the author of Svelte, describes his creation as [“a framework without the framework”](https://svelte.dev/blog/frameworks-without-the-framework).

Svelte is based on a tool for compiling components (essentially, Svelte.js is a compiler itself) at the build stage, allowing you to load only what is needed to display your application on the page – small, “digestible” JavaScript code. This means there is no virtual DOM, no frameworks on top of frameworks, and no framework at runtime. This is the main difference between Svelte and Vue, and the main argument in the Svelte vs. React vs. Angular vs. Vue battle.

Among the most crucial arguments in Svelte.js vs. React vs. Vue is usage. The most common use cases of Svelte include:
- Single-page applications.
- Apps for low-power devices. Apps created with Svelte have less code, which essentially means fewer data to download, and that is perfect for low-power devices.
- Apps with interactive visualization. A framework with no runtime is much more convenient since it allows the visuals to be more responsive.

Consider interoperability. Want to npm install cool-calendar-widget and use it in your app? Previously, you could only do that if you were already using (a correct version of) the framework that the widget was designed for – if cool-calendar-widget was built in React and you're using Angular then, well, to bad. But if the widget author used Svelte, apps that use it can be built using whatever technology you like.

# Svelte and Vue Ability to Build Complex Apps
### Svelte
If you have an idea for a large complex application, Svelte is not the best choice for the front end. Despite showing great results in a Svelte vs. Vue performance analysis, this framework is still young and lacks support, backing, and community. With no styles and kits, the amount of work you have to do by yourself will probably soon outweigh the positives that come with Svelte.

### Vue
With major backing from Google and relatively strong community support, building a complex app using Vue seems easier. Not mentioning the Vuex, which greatly facilitates the task. The difference between Svelte and Vue – having the ability to develop larger and more complicated apps – might be a make or break for someone who plans to quickly scale up their business and add more functions.
