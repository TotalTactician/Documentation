### Svelte JS

Rich Harris, the author of Svelte, describes his creation as [“a framework without the framework”](https://svelte.dev/blog/frameworks-without-the-framework).

svelte
Svelte is based on a tool for compiling components (essentially, Svelte.js is a compiler itself) at the build stage, allowing you to load only what is needed to display your application on the page – small, “digestible” JavaScript code. This means there is no virtual DOM, no frameworks on top of frameworks, and no framework at runtime. This is the main difference between Svelte and Vue, and the main argument in the Svelte vs. React vs. Angular vs. Vue battle.

Among the most crucial arguments in Svelte.js vs. React vs. Vue is usage. The most common use cases of Svelte include:
- Single-page applications.
- Apps for low-power devices. Apps created with Svelte have less code, which essentially means fewer data to download, and that is perfect for low-power devices.
- Apps with interactive visualization. A framework with no runtime is much more convenient since it allows the visuals to be more responsive.
