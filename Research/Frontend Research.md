# Research Front-end framework

### VUE

The difference between Svelte and Vue lies also in versatility. Vue is pretty much a universal framework that can be used for any project of yours.
The most suitable apps developed in this framework are single-page apps, MVPs, progressive web apps, and dynamic landing pages. In React, Svelte, and Vue comparison only Svelte is somewhat specific in its functionality, React and Vue can do pretty much everything.

Not only is it a popular main framework, but a lot of the popular web apps also use this framework on an occasional basis. Google used it for its careers page, Apple for its SwiftUI tutorial, and Nintendo when developing its loyalty page. Upwork, Nestle, Trivago, Nespresso – the list goes on and on, which stresses the multipurposeness of this framework.

On the issue of Svelte.js vs. Vue, developers are currently choosing Vue. The main difference between Svelte and Vue, in this case, is age. By the way, if you want to build an app on Vue.js ProCoders can help you with that! You can hire our Vue.js developers and recreate the success of these apps.

### Svelte JS

Rich Harris, the author of Svelte, describes his creation as [“a framework without the framework”](https://svelte.dev/blog/frameworks-without-the-framework).

Svelte is based on a tool for compiling components (essentially, Svelte.js is a compiler itself) at the build stage, allowing you to load only what is needed to display your application on the page – small, “digestible” JavaScript code. This means there is no virtual DOM, no frameworks on top of frameworks, and no framework at runtime. This is the main difference between Svelte and Vue, and the main argument in the Svelte vs. React vs. Angular vs. Vue battle.

Among the most crucial arguments in Svelte.js vs. React vs. Vue is usage. The most common use cases of Svelte include:
- Single-page applications.
- Apps for low-power devices. Apps created with Svelte have less code, which essentially means less data to download, and that is perfect for low-power devices.
- Apps with interactive visualization. A framework with no runtime is much more convenient since it allows the visuals to be more responsive.

Consider interoperability. Want to npm install cool-calendar-widget and use it in your app? Previously, you could only do that if you were already using (a correct version of) the framework that the widget was designed for – if cool-calendar-widget was built in React and you're using Angular then, well, too bad. But if the widget author used Svelte, apps that use it can be built using whatever technology you like.

## Svelte and Vue Ability to Build Complex Apps
### Svelte
If you have an idea for a large complex application, Svelte is not the best choice for the front end. Despite showing great results in a Svelte vs. Vue performance analysis, this framework is still young and lacks support, backing, and community. With no styles and kits, the amount of work you have to do by yourself will probably soon outweigh the positives that come with Svelte.

### Vue
With major backing from Google and relatively strong community support, building a complex app using Vue seems easier. Not to mention Vuex, which greatly facilitates the task. The difference between Svelte and Vue – having the ability to develop larger and more complicated apps – might be a make or break for someone who plans to quickly scale up their business and add more functions.

# final thoughts
We are going to use Svelte because it's a new innovative framework that specializes in high performance and reactivity, something which is very important for our application. The syntax also seems more readable. 

The main downside is that there is a smaller ecosystem compared to Vue which makes it more difficult to find help if we have any issues. Furthermore, Svelte is mostly used for smaller apps but we want to try it for ourselves and take a risk.
