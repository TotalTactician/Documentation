## Personal project
Since we are collaborating on a shared project, we serve as our own stakeholders. Consequently, determining the requirements and crafting user stories was relatively effortless.
However, despite the smooth progress, we did engage in discussions regarding specific design choices, which proved to be beneficial. These discussions compelled us to thoroughly consider every aspect rather than simply rushing through the process.

For the design choices on the application structure, see [here](https://github.com/TotalTactician/Documentation/blob/main/Proof/Joey/Web%20Application.md#application-structure).
