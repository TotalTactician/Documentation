## Personal project
Since we are collaborating on a shared project, we serve as our own stakeholders. Consequently, determining the requirements and crafting user stories was relatively effortless.
However, despite the smooth progress, we did engage in discussions regarding specific design choices, which proved to be beneficial. These discussions compelled us to thoroughly consider every aspect rather than simply rushing through the process.

The image below showcases a rudimentary sketch depicting our desired appearance for the faction selection page.

Based on the provided image, we developed the actual web page, which subsequently transformed into the image displayed below. 
The composition of the page largely remained consistent, with only certain elements, such as size, undergoing modifications.
