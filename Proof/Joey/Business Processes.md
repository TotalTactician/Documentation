## Personal project
Before starting on the program, it was essential to identify the problem we aimed to address. Sylvester and I are avid enthusiasts of the turn-based strategy and real-time tactics video game called Total War: Warhammer 3. 
This game features a diverse array of races, including greenskins, elves, Skaven, and many more. Each faction possesses distinct types of infantry, ranged units, cavalry, and various other types of troops, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. 
Remembering the ideal unit composition to counter specific enemy units can be quite challenging. Therefore, our goal was to develop a solution that would make it easier to determine the ideal army composition for defeating a given enemy force.

In the diagram below you can see the way that the process would go in the use-case of our application.
