## Intro
In our workflow and programming, we had to make several adjustments due to cultural differences within our group. The most significant difference was that one of our team members, Artjoms, is from Latvia, not the Netherlands like the rest of the group.
This had its challenges and advantages.

In our project aimed at data analysts and salespersons in large wholesale stores, we prioritize code ethics and adhere to the principles of Professional Competence set forth by the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery).
By incorporating certain technologies, we ensure that our project aligns with industry standards and leverages the most effective tools available, all while upholding the code ethics and professional competence expected in the field.

We made a document for this in our group project, see [here](https://github.com/Null-Not-Found/DashBuddy-Documentation/blob/main/Learning%20Outcomes/Cultural%20differences%20and%20ethics.md).
