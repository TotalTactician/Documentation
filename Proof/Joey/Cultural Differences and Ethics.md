## Intro
In our workflow and programming, we had to make several adjustments due to cultural differences within our group. The most significant difference was that one of our team members, Artjoms, is from Latvia, not the Netherlands like the rest of the group.
This had its challenges and advantages.

We made a document for this in our group project, see [here](https://github.com/Null-Not-Found/DashBuddy-Documentation/blob/main/Learning%20Outcomes/Cultural%20differences%20and%20ethics.md).
