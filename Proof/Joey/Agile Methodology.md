## What is Agile and Scrum
Agile is a project management approach and mindset that emphasizes flexibility, iterative development, and continuous improvement. 
It focuses on delivering value incrementally, gathering feedback from stakeholders, and adapting to changing requirements throughout the project's lifecycle. 
Agile promotes collaboration, transparency, and a customer-centric approach, enabling teams to respond quickly to challenges and deliver successful outcomes in a dynamic business environment.

Scrum is a specific framework within the Agile methodology that provides a structured approach to project management. It emphasizes teamwork, iterative development, and frequent communication. 
Scrum divides projects into short iterations called sprints, typically lasting one to four weeks, during which teams collaborate to deliver a potentially shippable product increment. 
Scrum includes ceremonies such as daily stand-up meetings, sprint planning, sprint reviews, and retrospectives to ensure transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement. 
It promotes self-organization, adaptive planning, and a focus on delivering value to customers.

## Agile in the group project
For our group project we decided to use Jira for our backlog and sprint board, we also thought about using trello or Githhub Projects but felt that Jira was more usefull and clearer.
It is also easy to connect it to Github for tracking a branch associated to a issue.

For this project we followed sprints of 3 weeks where before each sprint we look at the backlog and decide what to do next, and after every sprint we had a retrospecive.

### retrospectives
For the retrospectives we Used the 4 Ls method where we ask ourselfs these 4 questions: 
- What did we Like this sprint?
- What did we learn this sprint?
- what dit we Lacked this sprint?
- what do we long for in the next sprints?
