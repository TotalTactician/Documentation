## Intro
Working with Agile/Scrum is an adaptive and collaborative approach to project management that prioritizes iterative development, customer feedback, and cross-functional teamwork. 
It enables teams to respond to changing requirements, deliver incremental value, and create a culture of continuous improvement. Through its emphasis on transparency and frequent communication.

## What are Agile and Scrum
Agile is a project management approach and mindset that emphasizes flexibility, iterative development, and continuous improvement. 
It focuses on delivering value incrementally, gathering feedback from stakeholders, and adapting to changing requirements throughout the project's lifecycle. 
Agile promotes collaboration, transparency, and a customer-centric approach, enabling teams to respond quickly to challenges and deliver successful outcomes in a dynamic business environment.

Scrum is a specific framework within the Agile methodology that provides a structured approach to project management. It emphasizes teamwork, iterative development, and frequent communication. 
Scrum divides projects into short iterations called sprints, typically lasting one to four weeks, during which teams collaborate to deliver a potentially shippable product increment. 
Scrum includes ceremonies such as daily stand-up meetings, sprint planning, sprint reviews, and retrospectives to ensure transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement. 
It promotes self-organization, adaptive planning, and a focus on delivering value to customers.

## Agile in the group project
For our group project, we decided to use Jira for our backlog and sprint board, we also thought about using Trello or Githhub Projects but felt that Jira was more useful and clearer.
It is also easy to connect it to GitHub for tracking a branch associated with an issue.

For this project, we followed sprints of 3 weeks where before each sprint we look at the backlog and decide what to do next, and after every sprint, we had a retrospective.

### retrospectives
For the retrospectives, we Used the 4 Ls method where we ask ourselves these 4 questions: 
- What did we like about this sprint?
- What did we learn this sprint?
- what did we lack this sprint?
- what do we long for in the next sprints?

### User stories
A User story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer.

In the 4th sprint, we also started to use story points, story points are a way of determining how hard a story is. 
The points do not convey time or complexity and are more arbitrary so it can be tricky to use them. We decided that the points are like chickens: You can easily take on 1 chicken, but 8 chickens will be a lot harder. 

For the acceptance criteria, we used the given when then method. With this method, you can describe what this user story needs, what should happen, and when that happens.

For tasks, we use a more specific way to describe the technical criteria.
