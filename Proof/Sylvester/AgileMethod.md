## Intro
Scrum Agile is a widely adopted project management framework that enables teams to effectively tackle complex projects.
This framework encourages flexibility, adaptability, and continuous improvement, enabling teams to respond swiftly to changing requirements and deliver value early and frequently.

It embraces an iterative and incremental approach, breaking down the work into manageable chunks called sprints. 

## What is Scrum Agile?
Scrum is an Agile framework for managing and delivering complex projects. It provides a lightweight structure for teams to collaborate and respond to changing requirements, promoting iterative and incremental development. Scrum consists of specific roles, events, artifacts, and rules that work together to facilitate the project's progress.

Agile is an overarching philosophy and set of values that prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction in software development. It encourages adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement. Agile methodologies aim to promote teamwork, transparency, and customer-centricity.

When Scrum and Agile are combined, Scrum becomes a manifestation of the Agile principles. Scrum embodies the values of Agile by offering a practical and tangible framework to implement Agile concepts in a project. It provides a structured approach that embraces iterative cycles, emphasizes frequent feedback, and fosters cross-functional collaboration.

## Scrum Agile compared to Waterfall

|  | Agile Scrum | Waterfall |
| - | --------- | --------- |
| Approach and Flexibility | Scrum is an iterative and incremental approach where projects are divided into short sprints, allowing for frequent feedback and the ability to adapt to changing requirements. It offers flexibility, encourages collaboration, and enables continuous improvement. | Waterfall follows a sequential, linear process where each phase (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment) is completed before moving to the next. It is a more rigid approach with limited room for changes once a phase is completed. |
| Customer Satisfaction and Adaptability | Scrum focuses on delivering value to the customer early and frequently through product increments. The iterative nature of Scrum allows for continuous feedback and adaptation, ensuring that customer needs and expectations are met effectively. | Waterfall's linear approach makes it challenging to incorporate changes once a phase is completed, potentially leading to misalignment with customer requirements and satisfaction. |
| Communication and Collaboration | Scrum emphasizes collaboration within self-organized teams, fostering communication and knowledge sharing. Regular meetings like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives facilitate team coordination and shared decision-making. | Waterfall typically has less emphasis on collaboration and relies more on individual expertise within each phase, with limited interaction between teams. Communication tends to be more formal and structured. |
| Risk Management | Scrum allows for early identification and mitigation of risks through iterative development and regular feedback loops. The short sprints enable teams to detect and address potential issues sooner. | Waterfall's sequential nature makes it challenging to identify and address risks until later stages, increasing the chances of discovering problems late in the project lifecycle. |
| Planning and Estimation | Scrum employs dynamic and adaptive planning. Instead of creating a detailed plan upfront, the team plans and estimates work for each sprint, allowing for greater accuracy and flexibility in responding to changes. | Waterfall requires extensive planning and estimation at the beginning of the project, based on fixed requirements. Changes to the initial plan can be time-consuming and costly. |

In summary, the advantages of Scrum Agile over Waterfall include adaptability to changing requirements, customer satisfaction through early and frequent value delivery, improved communication and collaboration within teams, and early risk mitigation. However, Scrum Agile may require a higher level of coordination and self-organization from the team, and its flexibility can introduce uncertainty compared to the more structured and predictable nature of Waterfall.

## Using Scrum Agile in our projects

At the beginning of the two projects I have worked on this semester we had to decide upon which method we wanted to use to work with Scrum Agile. At first we considered using Trello but we quickly let that go due to the lack of features we would need. Next we looked at Github project boards and Jira. I tried the Github project board for a short time on my project, but quickly changed over to Jira after merging my project with Joey. For the group project we decided that Jira was going to be the best course of action due to its ability to integrate with github and its ease of use.
