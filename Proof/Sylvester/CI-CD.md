## Intro
Whilst I was creating the Frontend I thought it would be helpful to implement some form of automation in my toolkit using github actions. 
This automation allows me to automatically build my Node.js application and test it before I merge my code, ensuring that my code wont break production and catching problems I might not have seen during development.
It also automatically pushes a Dockerimage to Dockerhub making it easier to run any form of Production enviroment without having to spend a lot of time getting everything built and setup every time I update main.
