## Intro
During the semester I worked together with Joey on this project. We had no external stakeholders and as such were our own stakeholders. This lead to us having less problems creating User Stories and requirements took less time since there was less back and forth with stakeholders. We did spend more time debating the architecture and design choices, this was beneficial to the potential of the application but it did take up a good chunck of our time.
