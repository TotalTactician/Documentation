## Intro
During this project we setup a web application, whilst it is not done and not everything is implemented we have a clear vision of where we wanted to take this next. So some of the schemes are not yet fully implemented.

## Application Architecture
Below you can see the original scheme for a SQL database that we were planning to use originally. After some reconsideration we changed to using NoSQL and microservices making a large structured database unnecessary. However this scheme has still been helpful in guiding us trough the many different entities we have.

In the scheme below you can see our architecture that we landed on after some time. We decided that we wanted to use the Gateway pattern in our microservice based architecture because this pattern allows us to solves some issues around microservices like Aggregation and Composition and allows us to do things like Load balancing, better Security and Access control.
