## Intro
Before we started developing this project we had to decide what it is that we are trying to improve. Me and Joey are both avid players of the game Total War: Warhammer 3 and its not the most simple of games. One of the aspects that can be difficult is to build good armies. The game does not have any built in tools to really build armies and look at stats and synergies outside of looking at each and every unit individually. WSo we set out to make that aspect easier by making a tool that allows you to build armies and look at the units stats to make it easier to build armies. 

However a good army isnt always effective, some opponents might be strong against specific units that you use. A group of dwarfs with long range rifles will make ***short*** work of any large monster whilst that large monster might maul on your frontline units. So for this we decided that it would be nice to have something that can generate an army that is most effective against your opponent automating the process of figuring out which units you have that you can use, finding the right balance of them and then looking at synergies. Taking up a lot of time you can also spend actually playing the game and having fun.

In the diagram below you can see the way that the process would go in the use-case of our application.
