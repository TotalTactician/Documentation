## Intro
In this document, I will provide you with the learning outcomes at the time of writing (June 1, 2023) for this semester. 
I did this project with [Sylvester Snijders](https://github.com/AsterosTheGreat) So this document has a table with the explanation of said outcomes and all of my work with which I prove I have accomplished them.

## Learning outcomes
For a complete list of the learning outcomes and their explanation as of June 1, 2023, see [here](https://github.com/TotalTactician/Documentation/blob/main/learning-outcomes.md).

# Self-assessment

Below, I will provide the reader with a self-assessment. In this assessment I will assess my own qualities, and explain how I think I quality for the given learning outcome (as they are laid out [here](dict/learning-outcomes.md)). 

The proficiency rating I will give myself are as they are described on [CANVAS](https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/12518/outcomes) on December 20th 2022. The rating goes from '*Undefined*', to '*Orienting*', to '*Beginning*', '*Proficient*' and finally to '*Advanced*', on a scale of 0 to 5.
