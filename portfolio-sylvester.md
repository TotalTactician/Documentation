## Intro
This document serves as a repository that represents the proof of the work I have done in S3 software engineering Spring 2023 in order to accomplish the learning outcomes that are used as of the time of writing (May 10th 2023). These can be found below. 

Following that is a table with references to the work I have done to prove I have fulfilled the requirements.
## Learning Outcomes
For a full overview of all the learning outcomes see [here](https://github.com/TotalTactician/Documentation/blob/main/learning-outcomes.md)
## Proof

For the Prediciton of the grade:
 - 0 - Undefined
 - 1 - Orienting
 - 2 - Beginning
 - 3 - Proficient
 - 5 - Advanced
