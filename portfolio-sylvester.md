## Intro
This document serves as a repository that represents the proof of the work I have done in S3 software engineering Spring 2023 in order to accomplish the learning outcomes that are used as of the time of writing (May 10th 2023). These can be found below. 

Following that is a table with references to the work I have done to prove I have fulfilled the requirements.
## Learning Outcomes
For a full overview of all the learning outcomes see [here](https://github.com/TotalTactician/Documentation/blob/main/learning-outcomes.md)
## Proof

For the Prediciton of the grade:
 - 0 - Undefined
 - 1 - Orienting
 - 2 - Beginning
 - 3 - Proficient
 - 5 - Advanced

## Outsourcing
The two people that were involved in the outsourcing can be found here:
 - [Bram](https://github.com/BramVerkuijlen)
 - [Stijn](https://github.com/Spider-Frog)
### Outsourcing to Bram
We outsourced setting up the datastore for Units. With this we included in the frontend the file where the store would be, the model for the unit premade in the store and a worked out set of tasks.
Feedback from Bram:
The task was easy to read and the subtasks were small enough to work on easily, but I missed acceptance criteria for what should happen if something goes wrong (such as what happens if no units are returned). It is also nice if it can be reported with the tasks what the api call returns or a link to the documentation for the call (if you need the api call of course). I donâ€™t really like separate tasks with separate user stories, but it works I guess.
### Outsourcing to Stijn
We outsourced setting up the component that displays the information of the Unit from the datamodel that is in the Unit datastore. With this we included the file for the store with the model in it and a worked out set of tasks
Feedback from Stijn:
### Outsourcing from Stijn
I was given the task to make a searchbar that can search the dataset of products displayed on the page. For this I was given links to the Official documentation of the 4 libraries I would primarily be using.
My experience with the project:
I couldnt really figure out how the structure of the application worked that easily. It also didnt help that I had no experience with Vue. Ontop of this I had to learn how multiple libraries worked and try to figure out how to combine some of these libraries without much documentation on how to do this exactly. I couldnt use the existing codebase and documentation to figure out how the libraries worked either because there was no documentation to work off of. I could not figure out how to get it working in the time available to me for the story. 
My feedback given to Stijn:
- The project board is decently organized. You can see what is done, what has to be done and what is finished. However you cannot really see which tasks are part of which user story.  
- The project isn't the most friendly *yet* for new people to step into due to the amount of time you need to spend learning the libraries and the lack of documentation inside the project that explains what does what making it difficult to figure out how the application works without prior knowledge of it. 
- The links to the official documentation of certain libraries inside the tasks helped steer where I needed to search online for information but the documentation wasnt enough to make sure I could fulfill the story.
- Including the time it takes to get acclimated to the enviroment, learning libraries and making the actual thing Id say this story would be around 3 to 4 points for someone new joining the project.
- Members dont have write permission by default so I cannot push code to the codebase at all
